How many artifacts each?



50 each for a total of 150? We'll see how long it takes for each artifact.
(currently thinking 20 artifacts each... or 60 total)


Should we change cursed to supernatural?





MISCELLANEOUS: 

For the cover picture, use a Japanese Kokeshi Doll from the Edo period (1600-1868), as Nintendo's Miis were inspired by Kokeshi Dolls in terms of their shapes
